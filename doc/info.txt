PPLNS
Pay Per Last N Shares (PPLNS) is a method of distributing earnings amongst
miners. It distributes payouts for each block amongst the last N shares,
regardless of when the previous block was found. This solves the issue of pool
hopping, where it is more profitable to mine straight after a block is found.
With PPLNS, loyal miners will get the better profits. 
mineXMR has switched to PPLNS with a window of approximately 30 minutes
(dependant on factors including pool hashrate). This means that there will be a
ramp up and ramp down in payments when you start or stop mining.

Invalid Shares
Invalid shares should not occur with a properly set up miner. They are commonly
caused by unstable overclocks. The shares will not be credited, and your miner
will be notified. There is no penalty for submitting invalid shares, however if
you submit too many you will be banned for 10 minutes to prevent DDOS attacks.

Expired Shares
Expired shares are a regular occurance, since there is always some latency
(measured in ms) between the network finding a new block and all miners being
notified. Some miners however error out when the pool tells them the submission
is expired. Because of this, the pool will send an OK to recently expired
shares and you will be able to see them in your detailed stats soon, instead of
seeing it in your miner output.
